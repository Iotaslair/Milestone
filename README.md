# Milestone
I spent the month of January 2019 creating this Android App. It's a calendar app that takes advantage of the idea of Gamification.
I define Gamification as applying the ideas play to normal tasks.  
(There's a really great video explaining what Gamification is by Extra Credits. It's a little old now but still really good
