[Milestone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.williampembleton.milestone) is an application that takes the idea of Gamification and applies it to a task management application. There's a really great video explaining what Gamification is by Extra Credits.

# Story behind the app
I made an app very similar to this in High School with a partner for the Congressional App Challenge [Link to application video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U2J2g1ke1Y) but I didn't enjoy the UI and I wanted to recreate the app because my partner did the development. So I recreated the application to learn about Android development, revamp the design and produce a deliverable that employers can see.
