# Story behind the app
I originally made an app very similar to this in High School with a partner for the Congressional App Challenge [Link to application video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U2J2g1ke1Y) but I didn't enjoy the UI and I wanted to revamp it because my partner did most of the development and at the time we didn't know about git to share files. So I recreated the application to learn about Android development, revamp the design and produce a deliverable that employers could see.
