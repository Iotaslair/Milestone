Today I did some work with getting an app in Android Studio that I could put on my phone. There wasn't much more work that I did today because I worked on and off, most of the time was spent goofing off while Android Studio downloaded things. I also spent some time looking into Android Jetpack to see what it offers. As of right now I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with it.

Today I did a few things. I did some reading on Material Design on how the overall system works. I'm currently working through creating the first app that Google recommends (https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/). I hope to get the app finished sometime before we start planning our little vacation to NC to see snow. I was able to complete some of the app it now has a text box that stretches to the size of the screen

Nothing was done today, was busy helping Dad prepare a home proposal.
12/19/18
Nothing was done today; Did vacation planning and went shopping for said vacation
12/20/18
Did some more work with the first app Android recommended. Found a way to transition between activities and pass information between the two activities.
12/21/18 
Finished the first app (needed to make a small change to the manifest file). Started playing around with the colors on my main app
12/22/18
Found out about Firebase and logged into Android Studio. Watched some of a gentle introduction to gradle (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFUEb7pLLXw) found it to be not useful. Learned how to publish an app. Learned how banner ads are made. Worked on making a new task xml file.
12/23/18-1/5/19
Nothing due to vacation
1/6/18
Worked on adding and hooking up a lot more labels in the new task activity. I also started making a new class called Task which holds what the tasks are and also made a static class that holds all tasks that have not been completed (singleton) (EDIT: since changed no longer singleton).
1/7/18
Changed the due date to tomorrow instead of today. Completed Difficulty. Time To Complete completed. Added error messages if a title is empty and such. Considered doing scaling xp by level but considered it unnessary. Made a numerical version of difficulty in Task.java. Made up formula for Exp and implemented it. Sent back to main activity when a new task was made.
1/8/18
Nothing was completed on the project, instead I worked on updating my resume and returning my old phone. 
1/9/18
Learned how the android manifest file works, Learned an important lesson that git is very useful to test something and go back to what you had easily. Nothing substantial was done today, just kinda felt crappy.
1/10/18
Learned a lot about how to make the task list. I learned how to build a custom adapter so that I can build custom bits of xml that looks like a task. 
1/11/18
Got date formatted correctly, task list looks well enough and TTC now accepts decimal times. Also updated the toString for tasks to be better formatted
1/12/18
Made a few small changes like making fab on task list work and small changes to how tags are handled when a task is created.
1/13/18
Got rid of app bar for a custom one. Learned a lot about how toolbars works and the power of building a general thing and allowing the other acivities to use the general thing. Learned how to save data in the app (so when a user closes the app it doesn't restart). Made a SharedData object and used Gson (google's library to help with json) to convert the array of tasks into json then saved that as a string that SharedData can handle. 
1/14/18
Nothing happened because I went on a 20k bike ride and was too physically tired to do anything
1/15/18
Converted ListView in tasklist for a RecyclerView which works a lot faster and has a better design. 
1/16/18
Finished making the 3 bar menu. Continued my learning on how the tool bar works. Fixed up the Fab and toolbar on TaskList because they were acting up.
1/17/18
Lots of work on the Calendar. I used someone else's calendarview so that when a day is clicked it takes you to a task list with only tasks for that day.
1/18/18
I have the save button in the correct position now. Uses snackbars instead of toast messages to make things more pretty. I previously made a simple mistake where the app's name got messed up with the toolbar's name. I also made a searching system and learned how menus can be used in Toolbars.
1/19/18
Today the main thing that I completed was making it so that tasks can be completed, I wasn't able to do a star exploding animation like I wanted when a task is complete. I also didn't get around to making a way for a task to be deleted. I want to allow players to delete tasks by the time the app is released but I'm not certain about doing the animation because I see it as extra work that's not super necessary.
1/20/18
I made a health bar and exp bar where the health bar heals every level and you level up by gaining xp. Player info saved after app closed. I tried to make it so that when a player completes a task the xp bar fills up when they watch it but for some reason this doesn't happen. It does the animation every time you close the activity and re-open it the animation plays again. Made a 1/25 chance that players find health potions when a task is complete. Made textual version of health and xp bars. Implemented a streak system.
1/21/18
Today I spent most of the morning tracking down a weird bug that healed you when you completed a task, turns out the player just leveled up and I didn't recognize it for a long time. Lesson learned to use more print statments (like saying the player leveled up) I also revamped the system that damages players for tasks that they failed. Also told the player when they failed a task. Fixed EXP bar so it works when drawer opens. Needed to set max xp before setting actual xp. Made a swipe to delete feature in TaskList. Made it so that NewTask can now scroll.
1/22/18
Today I mostly did refactoring of the code, changing a quite a bit of minor things and added comments on the methods since the last refactor. 
1/23/18
Today's the day the app was uploaded to Google Play. I did a few other maintenance things like making the readme and make the icon and banner used for uploading the app. 


Wishes for the app that didn't get done:
Do animations when a task is completed.
Use fragments instead of activities for speed increase and not have to load tons of stuff when starting activity
Repeatable tasks
Sounds when task completed


To do:
Clean up tasklistsearched
