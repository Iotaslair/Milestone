Short:
Task Manager with Gamification. That's all

Long:
This is an application I made for my ISP (Independent Study Project) in the month of January 2019. 

WARNING: Don't go messing around with the date in your phone or you'll have to uninstall the app and reinstall it, thus resetting all your progress

Milestone is a simple task management app that incorporates lessons from games like leveling systems. For an explanation of what gamification is I recommend checking out this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dLK9MW-9sY .The video is a little bit old but still really helpful.

This app works without the need for an internet connection, nor requires you to make accounts.
This app also doesn't include any advertisements for you're enjoyment.
